Transportation Guide App


This is a transportation guide app aimed to provide information to people while using local transportation 
through the data added on the local sqlite database.

#The most useful feature in this app is that it can calculate SHORTEST PATH to the app user by calculating distances between consecutive
two bus stops. 
#Another useful feature is that it has offline map from "Mobile Atlas Creator 2.0.1" (but for now has to be added to 
osmdroid folder of phone).
#other are just normal activities and fragments for future upgrade.
